# What is scrollgame

This is a practice for small game framework. It's dom based not canvas based. Why I choose dom here? That's lots of reasons but the crucial one is using dom is much easier than using canvas. For example, you don't need to consider the drawing system (ex. double buffer..), easier creating game UI, etc.

Maybe, I will try to implement a canvas-based framework in the future.
