# my-travel-in-learning-javascript

I will start some project to practice -- just like my-travel-in-learning-series repository. As a frontend engineer with not much experience, I will try hard to implement those project. Some of them may be just a revision of book's example code and some of them may be an implement of ideas from the book I read.


# Structure

I have not much sense about project structure of javascript currently so I won't rule this now. After some trying of projects, I'll revise this readme.


# About tests

Here, I will give Qunit a try.


# requirements

All requirements I keep in bower.json, although I think I will push them to the repo in the folder named bower_components.
